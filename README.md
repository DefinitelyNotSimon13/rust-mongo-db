# MongoDB and Rust
This project at it's core is me, trying out rust and how to work with MongoDB
and Rocket.

# Project JSON
As I also picked up an old project again, I am now able to use this project, to add
projects to a collection based on their project.json file.

# Future
I'd love to create a full-fledged backend with this project and my Json scripts
to be able to manage and archive my projects.
For that, the whole workflow will have to be improved.
At some point I also want to write a frontend.
